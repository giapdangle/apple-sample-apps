# The iOS Sample Code Repository

Welcome to the iOS Sample Code repository. In this repository we exhibit how the SDK can be used to perform the basic actions on the relayr platform.  

The following is demonstrated:

- Checking that the relayr cloud is reachable.
- Creating an app on the realyr cloud.
- Signing in to the cloud.
- Retrieving the transmitters and devices of a signed in user.
