# The iOS Sample Code Repository

Welcome to the Apple Sample Apps repository. In this repository we show how the SDK can be used to perform the basic actions on the relayr platform.  

The following is demonstrated:

- Checking that the relayr cloud is reachable,
- Creating an app on the realyr cloud,
- Signing in and out of to the cloud,
- Retrieving the transmitters of a signed in user, and
- Retrieving the devices of a signed in user.

## Caveats

At this time there is only sample code for an iOS app. Although the SDK does also support Mac no sample code has been written at this time. It will be added soon though.
